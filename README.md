@{ 
//this is java code block,you can write comments just like java does 
String name=MessageFormat.format("{0} {1}","",""); 
String who="superstudio";//declare a who varian 

} 
<!--in the say way you can write html comment outside code block--> 
<!--and the line below would output "hellow,superstudio"-->

</body> 
</html> 
```
